Soil classification enables understanding of the variation and sustainable use of soil across the landscape and ultimately across the world. Due to the different criteria used in soil classification, cross-referencing between systems is difficult. Although efforts have been made to build classification systems representing the world’s soils (e.g., World Reference Base for Soil Resources – WRB, Soil Taxonomy – ST), adopting these more global systems is often difficult given the intensive soil information previously collected and characterized using existing national systems. Recent research organized via the IUSS Working Group on Advances in Universal Soil Classification has attempted to build a dynamic Comprehensive Soil Classification System (CSCS) sequentially merging existing soil taxa (approximately at the Great Group level) from global, regional and national systems. Here, we present an updated system (CSCS2.0) comprising centroids of soil morphological (e.g., color), physical (e.g., particle size), and chemical (e.g., pH, exchangeable cations) properties measured in the 0–1.5 m depth. The optimized soil taxa originate from ST, WRB, Australian Soil Classification (ASC), New Zealand Soil Classification (NZ), French Soil Classification (Fr), Russian Soil Classification (Ru), Brazilian Soil Classification (Br), and Korean Soil Classification (Kr). CSCS2.0 characterizes soil taxa in the principal component space of the soil properties defining the centroids and allows identifying unknown soils quantitatively using names of existing soil taxa from various classification systems which are combined, or via a new systematic nomenclature created for the CSCS2.0. We hope to sequentially add taxa from other soil classification systems to build up a truly global representation.


In this GitHub Repository, we provided the R function and some sample data to demonstrate the use of the CSCS2.0 to allocate any unknown soil profile data to the CSCS2.0. If the distance of the unknown soil profile to the closest taxa in the CSCS2.0 is small than 25, we can assign the existing name of the closest taxa to this unknown profile. Otherwise, we would most likely need to add this profile as a new taxa in the CSCS2.0. For reference, please refer to our previously published papers on CSCS from here: Hughes, P., McBratney, A., Huang, J., Minasny, B., Hempel, J., Palmer, D. J., & Micheli, E. (2017).
